Task 0:
- O(1) since there are no loops

Task 1:
- O(n1 + n2) since there are 2 loops

Task 2:
- O(n1 + n2) since there are 2 loops

Task 3:
- O(n) since there is 1 main loop.
- O(2 * 3 * n):
    2 since len(list_of_codes) is 2,
    3 because there are 3 lines of code,
    n for the inner-loop [i for i in list_of_codes[k]['code']]
    so it'll become O(n^2)
- therefore O(n1) + O(n2^2) i.e. O(n1 + n2^2)

Task 4:
- O(n1 + n2) since there are 2 loops
